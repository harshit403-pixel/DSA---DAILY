🚀 DSA – DAILY

A dedicated repository for daily Data Structures & Algorithms practice using C++.
The goal is long-term consistency, strong fundamentals, and continuous improvement in problem-solving.

📚 Overview

This repository serves as a structured collection of DSA problems solved on a daily basis.
It reflects:

Consistent learning

Systematic problem categorization

Clean coding practices

Progress tracking through daily commits

📂 Repository Structure

The project begins with a minimal but scalable folder layout:

DSA-DAILY/
│
├── ImpQuestions/



Each directory will be expanded with well-organized solutions as more topics are covered.

🎯 Objectives

Develop strong command over core DSA concepts

Build a reliable daily coding habit

Prepare for technical interviews and competitive exams

Write clean, modular, and efficient C++ code

Maintain an active GitHub streak with meaningful contributions

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: C++

Paradigm: Problem-Solving & Algorithmic Thinking

Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code

🔄 Daily Practice Workflow

Every day includes:

Selecting 1–3 DSA problems

Implementing solutions in C++

Organizing files into the appropriate topic folder

Creating a short log entry (optional)

Committing & pushing changes to GitHub

🧾 Commit Message Standard

All commits follow a clear, consistent format:

Day 01: Added binary search implementation
Day 05: Solved palindrome using two-pointer technique
Day 08: Updated notes in daily-log


This ensures traceability and professionalism.

🗒️ Daily Log

A dedicated daily-log/ directory can track learning progress, including:

Concepts learned

Mistakes identified

Optimizations applied

Next day’s target

This encourages structured learning and refinement.

📈 Long-Term Vision

As the repository grows, it will evolve into:

A complete C++ DSA library

A revision resource

A personal portfolio of problem-solving ability

A documented journey of continuous self-improvement

🤝 Contributions

This is a personal learning repository.
However, suggestions or improvements via issues or pull requests are welcome.

⭐ Follow the Journey

More solutions, folders, and advanced topics will be added consistently as I progress.
